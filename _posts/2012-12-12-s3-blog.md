title: Moving from Wordpress to S3
---
Finally i decided to move away from Wordpress to a Static blog hosted
entirely on S3. I have a lot of things tied up with wordpress, planning
to move them over when i get more time, till then i will be using both
wordpress and S3, new blog location [http://blog.ankurs.com](http://blog.ankurs.com) and [Post Archive](http://blog.ankurs.com/archive.html)
