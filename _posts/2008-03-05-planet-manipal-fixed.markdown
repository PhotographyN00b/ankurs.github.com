Planet had a very bad habit of replacing the title of your post by your nickname or the image description of the image that is there in your post , finally i got a way to make planet not do that and well it was damnÂ  easy just switching the feeds from RSS to Atom works and no other setting is required. I am going to switch over to a proper hosting so will host Planet Manipal properly there and the updates will be more regular till then enjoy!!!!!!!
