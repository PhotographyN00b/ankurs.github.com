title: Enabling 3D effects in Ubuntu 7.10 on ATI x 1250

After a long time of SUSE use i went back to my Ubuntu install when i was reminded by Sohil about the 3D effects which were working on Ubuntu 7.04 with the new ATI 8.42.3 drivers and well it was like a challenge for me to enable those in my install. The way to enable those in your Ubuntu 7.10 fresh install with the ATI 8.42.3 drivers, just install the xserver-xgl package ` sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl ` and reboot enjoy
