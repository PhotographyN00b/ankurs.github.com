Somedays ago when i was traveling to Bangalore from Manipal in the Bus i read a tweet about MinWin from Aditya and day after that he tweeted this "aditya: @Ankur MinWin exists in Vista too. I'm still not buying the 'modular OS' theory, and from I've seen, W7 keeps me happy about buying a Mac :)" now i know he is a big mac fanboy but that made me think how many people are thinking that MinWin is a part of Windows 7 ( when ever it comes ) well its not, just see [this](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071019/eric-talk-demo-windows-7-minwin/) and notice

> Now, this is an internal only - you won’t see us productizing this - but you could imagine this being used as the basis for products in the future. This is the Windows 7 source code base, and it’s about 25 megs on disk. Compare that to the four gigs on disk that the full Windows Vista takes up. We don’t have a graphics subsystem other than text in this particular build

I also noticed this in Wikipedia

> A minimalistic variation of the Windows kernel, known as MinWin, was being developed for use in Windows 7

Come on people try to understand this MinWin in not something made exclusively for Windows 7, rather The code from Windows 7 Kernel was taken and slimmed down to make MinWin, so Windows 7 will be like addition of more crap over Vista
Now who will tell [them](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=842) [them](http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/win7_minwin_preview.asp) and [them](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071021-core-of-windows-7-taking-shape-meet-the-minwin-kernel.html)
Anyways i am Happy with my Fedora 9 Laptop........

PS - Aditya i have nothing against you buddy
