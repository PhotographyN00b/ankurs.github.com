There was a workshop conducted by engineers form SUN in my college regarding [JavaFX](http://javafx.com/), which went quite well. I was planning to start with JavaFX but as there was no Official release of any Linux SDK, it kept me back but this semester i had to install Windows because of my University which wants me to use Visual Studio for my mini project, so as i had Windows (unwillingly) on my system i planned to go and attend this JavaFX workshop.

From what i have learned in these two days, JavaFX looks promising for developing Rich Internet Applications, the language is somewhat a mixture of JavaScript and Java. With Type Inference , Audio/Video support  etc making it very easy to use and create applications with. 

In the workshop after every thing was over we were asked to make a simple application in JavaFX, so here is my code for a Simple pong game in JavaFX
the resolution is set to 1440x900 you can change it to your resolution in the code

if you cannot see the code see [here](http://snipt.net/ankur/a-simple-pong-game-in-javafx)
  
PS - as i dont normally boot into windows i dont think that i will do anything in it soon, i am waiting for Linux JDK to be released...
