Some the biggest problem with Ubuntu that i find is copying a VCD ( the one copying whom is legal!!!), But not anymore here is a simple way to copy those VCDs into simple mpeg files  u just need to install a program with apt-get and type a command and thats it. So first install vcdimager type

    sudo apt-get install vcdimager

after it gets installed just type

    vcdxrip

and you will find the avseq\*\*.mpeg files in your home folder enjoy
