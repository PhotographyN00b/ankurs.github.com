![Apple SDK](http://files.ankurs.com/apple-sdk-036.jpg)


 So finally the much-anticipated iPhone / iPod touch SDK (Software Development Kit) is released, this will start third-party development for these devices. Developers will have access to the same "Cocoa Touch" framework and all other APIs used by Apple for iPhone software development apart from this they will have access to hardware-accelerated 3D graphics, location-enabled applications and full access to all the media capabilities of the iPhone. The i[Phone dev center](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/) is there for what every you may need along with an Application distribution System for iPhone which has a revenue sharing scheme of 70:30 and also hosting for free applications. I am seriously waiting for iPhone to get released in India not to buy but just to use it and from what i have heard it will be Reliance with the iPhone.
