Finally there is a  Linux User Group in Manipal which will really make things a lot easy for people interested in learning about Linux and Open Source in Manipal.  

So how was this group formed???  

well there is this rule which does not allow new clubs to be formed in Manipal, so making a group was not an easy task there was some really great thinking and tackling done to make this LUG Manipal possible.  

First meeting of the group took place on 10th of this month,So what all happened in the First Ever meeting of LUG in manipal?????  

The session was scheduled to start from 5:15pm and it began on 5:20pm with the room NLH303 was almost full with people still coming after the start of the session. At first when i was told about formation of LUG first thought was not many people are going to come but as the time of the meet came close we were thinking that people might not fit in the room and if this would have happened near Diwali  there would have been huge turn up enough to fill 2 rooms, Anyway there were somewhere around 80 - 90 people. So first Shubendra (3rd year) and Ayush (3rd year) came and started with what are the objectives of the group and what all they planned to do, which was followed by Explanation of  Open Source Philosophy by Manish (3rd year) , which was followed by Video of Vista vs Beryl which according to most was best part, a Question Answer round was there in the end in which i jumped in ;-) and answered a lot of questions, there were some genuine questions like the audio/video codec support in Linux and some really shit questions like " What if i get stuck while trying something  on Linux and I dont have an internet connection, a phone to ask my friend for help and i dont want to look into help???  "  now what will some one answer him........  

here the end of the session was called and all the people who are interested in working on something were asked to stay back, here again there was surprise and some 35+ people stayed back for different work, which was really great

so the things LUG Manipal is working on are

  * A Linux [Install Fest](http://installfest.org)  -  infact the meeting in next semester will be the time when this will happen


  * Setting up of a Wiki ( this is the thing i am working on)


  * Setting up a Web Site of Lug manipal


  * More sessions on Linux and Open source


  * Increasing the uptake of Linux in Manipal


  * Starting up a Blog


  * There are also  plan for release of a monthly magazine
