Finally after waiting for a long time my Dell XPS 1530 arrived yesterday and it really rockss, i was supposed to get it on 3rd July but continuous delay were caused by curfew in Indore and some other factors.

The Config is
* Processor : Intel C2D T8100 - 2.1GHz
* RAM : 3GB 667MHz Dual Channel
* Graphics Card : GeForce 8600GT 256 MB
* Screen : 15.4" WXGA+ ( 1440x900 )
* WiFI card :  Intel 4965 802.11n
* OS : Windows Vista Home Preminum ( removed after an hour )

It looks gr8 far better then what i previously owned, HP 6515b which was given by my college MIT, Manipal.
As soon as i received my Dell first think i did was to run Windows Performance Index and the score came out to be 5.0 with 5.0 being the lowest score because of my 3GB RAM!!!

I tried some Windows Media Centre and then it was time to say vista good bye and say hello to Fedora 9, the install went without a hitch but when i booted i  that my mouse was not working, a quick search on forums and i had the solution add `i8042.nomux=1 ` as a kernel parameter and every thing was working, WiFi, LAN all worked out of the box, some yum install and my new notebook was ready to rock and roll
