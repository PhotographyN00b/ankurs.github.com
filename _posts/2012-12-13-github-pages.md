I have finally decide to move to Github Pages instead of S3, since i was anyways using jekyll, moving to github pages was easy, Github has some instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages), I have also added redirects from wordpress to this blog for the moment, there are few images/files which are pointing to wp-uploads in my older posts, I still need to move them somewhere else and then I can finally say bye bye to wordpress
