For the First time in History of Manipal a Linux ( Fedora 8 ) Install Fest took place on the Campus, it was organized by Linux user Group Manipal. It was Basically a 2 Day Fest, on 24th a Pre-Install Fest / Meet was there where participants were Informed about the requirements, advantages and Importance of GNU/Linux and what all we will be doing in the second day i.e. 25th , there were all information given about various events held by companies inviting students to innovate.  The Day ended with the collection of DVD to be burned for 25th Main Fest and some 45+ DVD's were collected with DVD's still coming till start of Second day

Second day began with partitioning and distribution of DVD's after which the main install fest began and all the steps were shown and explained, there was some DVD corruption / Improper burning but everything else was just fine, a script was prepared for upgrading Compiz and enabling 3D effects for the HP 6515b laptops, the script handled most of the task which were to be done in command line though all people were explained what it did but since most of the people were First Time users it really made the task of configuring the system very easy, rest laptops faced no problems so they directly booted in Graphical mode already being out of time the Install Fest was Finished with some problems still remaining which were solved
