Me moving to a proper hosted blog also means that everything is on a proper server, So the good news is that Planet Manipal is now online , that means it will get automatically updated every 4 hours and i wont have to Update it manually which will make it more usefull and i have also noticed that not all Manipal bloggers are on Planet rite now, So if you have a blog and are intrested in getting the blog aggregated in Planet Manipal you are most welcomed just mail me `ankur[at]ankurs[dot]com` with your feed url, Name and Batch

Keep Blogging
