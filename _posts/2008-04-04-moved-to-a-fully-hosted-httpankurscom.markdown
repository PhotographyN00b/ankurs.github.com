Finally i have moved to a fully hosted Wordpress 2.5 blog from my previous warofwords.wordpress.com blog and it rocks!!!!
Hosting is provided by Racked Hosting and the plan is very big for my needs so i am sharing it with Sohil who is going to bring a blog at http://weirdspectrum.com/ soon, he is planning for it right now, it will be up by tommorow.

Updates on my blog will be more regular now, i think i will be very busy this month but i wont let that come in between my blogging.

One thing about Racked Hosting -- They Rock!!!!!!!!!!Â  the server is extremely fast, extremely efficient and at a great price
so if you are looking for hosting you know where to go........
