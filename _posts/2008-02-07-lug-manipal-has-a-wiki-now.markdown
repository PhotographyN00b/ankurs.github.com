LUG is a collaborative project with people coming from all walks of life to work to work together for a common project or cause. Inspired by Wikipedia’s success as a collaborative project we thought of having a wiki at our site so that we can have a platform for working together. We can have vast details and ideas put up on the wiki for everyone to view later.

The Wiki’s URL is [http://wiki.lugmanipal.org](http://wiki.lugmanipal.org/)

come on people lets make it WWW == Wild Wild Wiki
