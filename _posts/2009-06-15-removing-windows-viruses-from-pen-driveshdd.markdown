last week i gave my 250GB HDD to one of my friend and when i got it back it was filled with viruses, it was that virus which creates .exe inside every , since there were a lot of folders in the HDD ( it was 200GB full ) it was practically impossible for me to go and delete every virus in there, so i decided to make a simple script to remove these viruses here it is
<script src="https://gist.github.com/123522.js?file=rmvirus.pl"> </script>

Download [here](http://gist.github.com/raw/123522/158dc4ed71fb8fe86250125eacfd9fd90b3ba2f9/rmvirus.pl)

PS - please be careful if you have windows programs they can also get deleted
