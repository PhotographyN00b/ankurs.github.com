Conky as its description says " It is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays any information on your desktop. " which well describes all that is there, and there are many different ways to configure it, well to be presise there are 250+ objects so the configuration options are limitless

[![My Desktop With Conky running ](http://ankurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/conky-300x187.png)](http://ankurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/conky.png)

above is the image of my Desktop running conky and i have 2 file one " .conkyrc " and other " .conky/ammarok " in my home folder (i.e /home/ankur/) the files are 
" [.conkyrc](http://files.ankurs.com/conkyrc) rename the file to **_.conkyrc_** "
and " **_[.conky/amarok](http://files.ankurs.com/amarok)_**" which is a amaroK info display script by eirc

you need to place amarok in ~/.conky/amarok make a folder .conky if it does not exist, also make ~/.conky/amarok executable, simply type " chmod +x ~/.conky/amarok " enjoy!!!

PS - If you dont have conky simply do yum install conky or sudo apt-get install conky
