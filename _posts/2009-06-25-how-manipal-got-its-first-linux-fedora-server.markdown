title: How Manipal got its first Linux (fedora) server

It all started with a failing Student's Teacher Feedback System, designed by few fourth year students of my college, in oct-nov 2008 the system was not able to scale and everything was reverted back to paper, it was then when i was contacted by a teacher from my Department ( Information and Communication Technology ), regarding if i can improve it.

i asked [DJ](http://djsh.net) if he wants to join me and after few weeks of coding there it was Manipal university's  first (working) Feedback System, when the point of hosting it came, i was surprised to find Manipal University has no Linux servers, i mean come on no Linux what are you people click sys admins, then we decided to setup our own server in the department, thus giving Manipal university its first Linux ( fedora 10 ) server.

currently it just hosts the Feedback System, but we are planning to use it as local ( internal ) fedora repository mirror, we need permission from the WiFi provider ION because almost all the students use only WiFi and not LAN, last time we tried we were denied by saying " You are  a threat to our network ", lets see how it goes this time. we will also require people to manage it but i think this can be handled very well by [LUG Manipal](http://lugmanipal.org), some pics

PS - i am looking for a way to convince them that setting up a mirror will be helpful for them as well as students can anyone suggest me how to go about it??
